# What is this
This is a Godot project built for [Acerola's Dirt Jam](https://itch.io/jam/acerola-dirt-jam). The goal is to take an existing terrain generation compute shader and make any improvements to it in one month.

# Update Log
7/24/25 - Initial Git commit. After much business this month, I finally got the basic terrain generation vertex and fragment shaders working! Some color improvements still need to be made to the fragment shader.

# Improvements
None yet!

# Project Goals
- Distance-based fog
- Distance-based LOD
- Shader includes
- Improved hash function
- Height precalculation
